# ATTPS Senior Engineer Code Challenge

This code challenge is an extension of our existing Junior challenge. It has the candidate develop an API which acts as a facade between multiple vendor endpoints and our own frontend.

In order to do this, we supplement the weather API with a separate location lookup API, seen here, so that the developer needs to do some work.

This challenge is language-agnostic.
